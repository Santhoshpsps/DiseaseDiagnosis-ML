# Disease-prediction-using-Machine-Learning
Implementation of various machine learning algorithms to predict the disease from symptoms given by user

# Introduction

DiseaseDiagnosis done using the symptoms given by the user.

# Algorithms 

1. Decision Tree
2. Random Forest
3. Naive Bayes

# Decison Tree

1. Decision tree algorithm falls under the category of supervised learning.
2. They can be used to solve both regression and classification problems.
3. Decision tree uses the tree representation to solve the problem in which each leaf node corresponds to a class label and attributes are represented on the internal node of the    tree.
4. We can represent any boolean function on discrete attributes using the decision tree.

# Random Forest
Random Forest works in two-phase first is to create the random forest by combining N decision tree, and second is to make predictions for each tree created in the first phase.

The Working process can be explained in the below steps :

Step-1: Select random K data points from the training set.

Step-2: Build the decision trees associated with the selected data points (Subsets).

Step-3: Choose the number N for decision trees that you want to build.

Step-4: Repeat Step 1 & 2.

Step-5: For new data points, find the predictions of each decision tree, and assign the new data points to the category that wins the majority votes.

# Naive Bayes

Naïve Bayes algorithm is a supervised learning algorithm, which is based on Bayes theorem and used for solving classification problems.
It is mainly used in text classification that includes a high-dimensional training dataset.
Naïve Bayes Classifier is one of the simple and most effective Classification algorithms which helps in building the fast machine learning models that can make quick predictions.
It is a probabilistic classifier, which means it predicts on the basis of the probability of an object.
Some popular examples of Naïve Bayes Algorithm are spam filtration, Sentimental analysis, and classifying articles.
